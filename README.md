# Fake It Till You Make It
An horror, survival game inside a house

This is an incomplete attempt from a pygame beginner to the [GitHubGameOff](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GitHubGameOff) Game Jam. But hey! Nothing bad for a first time game dev in 2 weeks.

### Requirements
Python, Pygame

### Intructions
Click at left or right corner of the screen to move. Make sure to move when you hear the dog, otherwise he will catch you.
Click at the bottom of the screen to start printing the mask.

### Lore
You are a hacker who somehow managed to get into a billionaire's house and get valuable information.
But when you were about to leave, the systems got activated. There is a smart guardian around the house that recognizes faces, so you need to get out soon before police gets there or that thing kills you.
You have a decent idea of how to make your way out. Fake a mask with owner's face till you make it to the exit.
